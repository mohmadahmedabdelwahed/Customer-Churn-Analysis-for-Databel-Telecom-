Title: 

Customer Churn Analysis for Databel Telecom 

 

Executive Summary: 

This project aimed to analyse customer churn at Databel Telecom using Power Query and Power BI. I cleaned and transformed the data, developed analytical measures, and built visual dashboards to uncover the key drivers behind customer churn. 

By leveraging demographic, subscription, and payment insights, I identified the customer segments with the highest churn likelihood. The analysis showed that most churn cases are driven by competitive offerings, device-related dissatisfaction, and poor customer support experiences. 

Key recommendations include: 

Benchmark competitors and address competitive gaps, as customer surveys indicate churn is largely due to better competitor offers (16.8%) and superior devices (16.5%). 

Increase long-term customer retention by incentivizing transitions away from month-to-month contracts, which currently show the highest churn rate (51%). 

Strengthen customer support, particularly for older customer segments, who show elevated churn rates and higher service interaction levels (average 2.4 calls per churned customer vs 0.37 for retained customers). Customer service attitude was the third most cited reason for churn (11.3%). 

 

Business Problem: 

To understand why customers are leaving and identify strategic actions to reduce the churn rate and improve customer lifetime value. 

 

Methodology: 

Utilized Power Query for data cleaning, structuring, and transformation. 

Built a suite of Power BI dashboards, including card visuals, pie/donut charts, bar charts, maps, line charts, and stacked column charts. 

Created analytical measures and KPIs to explore relationships between demographics, contract types, payment behaviours, and churn outcomes. 

 

Skills Applied: 

Data cleaning and transformation with Power Query 

DAX using nested IF, SWITCH(), and custom measures 

Data visualization and dashboard design in Power BI 

Analytical storytelling and insight generation 

 

Results & Recommendations: 

Address competitive disadvantages by analysing competitor pricing, device offerings, and service bundles. 

Promote long-term contracts to reduce churn risk associated with month-to-month customers. 

Enhance customer support quality and responsiveness, focusing on senior customer segments and reducing service-related dissatisfaction.
